<h2> Content stratgy</h2>
<p>My site will be one page and will consist of the following:</p>
<p><Strong>Welcome:</Strong> This will be a quick description of the page content. The section will have a border and background to stand out to the user </p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> For this section I would like an interactive card/image display showing the alphabet in upper and lower case next to each other. Using a collapse component I want the user to click and they will see an image and word associated with the letter they have chosen. I plan to have this section as one solid background color and each letter a unique color. </p>
<p><strong>About the Creator:</strong> I want this to be a brief paragraph or two explaining why i made this project. Highlighting how to use it and fun ways to tie it into other daily activites. It will display to the bottom left of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will contain a contact form, professional social media links: Linkedin and GitHub. It will display at the bottom right of the page </p>
<p><strong>Extras:</strong> My site will also include a navigation bar running at the top with links to the different sections. I plan to have a background for the whole page that the cards over lay. </p>
