<h2> Content stratgy</h2>
<p>My site will be one page and will consist of the following:</p>
<p><Strong>Welcome:</Strong> This will be a quick description of the page content. The section will have a border and background to stand out to the user </p>
<p><strong>Main Content:</strong> For this section I would like an interactive card/image display showing the alphabet in upper and lower case next to each other. Using a collapse component I want the user to click and they will see an image and word associated with the letter they have clicked on. I plan to have this section as one solid background color and letter box a unique color. </p>
